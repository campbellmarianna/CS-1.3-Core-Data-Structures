# Deletion in a Binary Search Tree
- No children
    - Just like deleting a tail from a LinkedList
- One Child
## Implementation
- Create Helper Function to find the predasessor
- Create Helper Function to find the successor
# Binary Search Tree
- Always sorted
- For each node
- Left children are smaller
- Right children are larger
- No duplicate keys (usually)

Traversing Trees
## Two Main Types
- Depth-first
    - Down first - visit child, then next descentdent
    - Always traverse left
    - subtree
    - def in order_dfs(node):
        if no
        in_order_def
- Breadth-first
