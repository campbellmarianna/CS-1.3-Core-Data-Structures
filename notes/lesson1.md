## Number Bases

After reading [Number Systems and Bases](https://betterexplained.com/articles/numbers-and-bases/), I learned that number systems are usually done in 10s and we use number systems in the real world, for telling time, reading measurements and for picking colors with hexidecimal numbers.

After watching the video [Hexadecimal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrFHGtGdOzA) from Harvard, I learned that hexadecimal numbers are used a memory addresses in our systems.
