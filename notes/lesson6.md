##Concrete Data Structure
- you can see and draw out how they are stored in memory
- array
- Linked List

## Abstract Data Types
- generic
- set (unordered collection of elements)
    - sets can be implemented
    - sets are concerned with membership

# Challenges
- __init__ = just like when I have a new class and I have to class and I have to create a tracker and add students later
- methods you will create are similar to venn diagrams
- write unit test = IT IS YOUR TIME!
    - write a test for every method in the class
    - very simple input (ex: I, V)
        - one letter words
    - read set up and tear down just pytest docs
- annotate all instance methods
    - contains should be fast
